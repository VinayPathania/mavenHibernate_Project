Q. What is Spring IOC container?
Ans - The Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework. The container will create the objects,
        wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction.
        The Spring container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application. These objects are
        called Spring Beans, which we will discuss in the next chapter.

      The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading the
        configuration metadata provided. The configuration metadata can be represented either by XML, Java annotations,
        or Java code. The following diagram represents a high-level view of how Spring works. The Spring IoC container
        makes use of Java POJO classes and configuration metadata to produce a fully configured and executable system
        or application.
