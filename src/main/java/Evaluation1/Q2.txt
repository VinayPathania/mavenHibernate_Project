Q1 Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate?
Ans- JPA
        1.Java Persistence API (JPA) defines the management of relational data in the Java applications.
        2.It is just a specification. Various ORM tools implement it for data persistence.
        3.It is defined in javax. Persistence package.
        4.The EntityManagerFactory interface is used to interact with the entity manager factory for the
            persistence unit. Thus, it provides an entity manager.
        5.It uses EntityManager interface to create, read, and delete operations for instances of mapped
            entity classes. This interface interacts with the persistence context.
        6.It uses Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) as an object-oriented query language to perform
            database operations.

    Hibernate
        1.Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool which is used to save the state of Java object
            into the database.
        2.It is one of the most frequently used JPA implementation.
        3.It is defined in org. Hibernate package.
        4.It uses SessionFactory interface to create Session instances.
        5.It uses Session interface to create, read, and delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes.
            It behaves as a runtime interface between a Java application and Hibernate.
        6.It uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL) as an object-oriented query language to perform database operations.
