Q1 What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?
Ans- 1.Database Dependency
        The Hibernate is not dependent on the database whereas in the case of JDBC the queries that need
        to be written are dependent on the database.
        So if we are using some database like MySQL or Postgres SQL in beginning but in the later stage,
        we have the liability of switching to another database like oracle.

     2.Optimized Code
        Hibernate creates shorter and optimized code. For example, by creating the connection while
        using Hibernate the developer should not need to write the complex queries because HCL is there
        to ease the written query whereas in JDBC it is the complete responsibility of the developer to program
        the queries.

     3.Caching
        Hibernate comes up with the caching mechanism. When a query is running multiple times then it
        can store the value instead of checking it repeatedly from the database. It is responsible to
        increase the performance of your system whereas in the case of JDBC there isnâ€™t any caching mechanism available.

     4.Associations
        Associate mapping can be done while using Hibernate. We can use associations like one to one and one
        to many through annotations. This helps to manage the entity in an easier way.
